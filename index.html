						<aside class="notes">
							The word itself, although unrelated to tech, can be first found in A New Latin Dictionary from 1879.
							In our case, the term comes from a tool developed by Stephen C. Johnson in 1978, called "lint".
							<br><br>
							"Lint" was used to analyse C source code and to help with figuring out compiler optimisations.
							Over time, similar tools started to add more types of checks and verification.
							<br><br>
							Nowadays, finding a project without any linter setup is not as hard as it should be.

							Imagine flying a plane with multiple pilots, but each of them have their own way of flying.
							There's no control nor uniformed way on how the plane should've been flown.
							</p>
							<p>
							When we start thinking about linters as a helping tools (and we configure it this way),
							it turns out, that:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>our productivity goes upwards (as we don't have to worry about how the code should look)</li>
								<li>the longetivity of the code extends as well</li>
								<li>you get more insights about how your code will perform in the future</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							Basically, our plane gets a set of rules that each pilot needs to follow,
							instead of everybody YOLO-ing everything.
							</p>
							<p>
							<!--
								// TODO: this needs to be explained within the greater Engineering context
							-->
							Engineering-wise, it's a basically a developer experience issue.
							Some will most definitely hate us introducing new set of rules to follow,
							some will absolutely love it. But what it does, it extends the longetivity of our code
							amd makes our codebase way easier to understand.
							</p>
							<p>
							Let's start introducing linters within our code!

							Working out linters is a very tricky bit. Although we can use the default setup and/or pick n' mix,
							there's two, very important things that we need to look at - knowing what we use and what our team makes of it.
							</p>
							<p>
							I'm a big advocate of actually knowing what you use rather than using things straight out of the box,
							without having a clue.
							In my opinion, you should aim for maximum security, the best quality without compromising readability.
							</p>
							<p>
							But, with that said, we need to work out the linters within the context of our team.

							Let's assume, you are starting the new linter implementation in your team - how to evaluate how far can you push them?
							</p>
							<p>
							Introducing - <b>The Maximum Pain Theory</b>
							</p>
							<p>
							What it is - basically, in order to make the linters work, you, as the <b>Linter Master</b>, are introducing
							the max pain setup - it doesn't mean that you actually enable all the linters that are available, but you should do 
							at least the minimum of research and tailor the linters to your project.
							</p>
							<p>
							Once you'll decide what goes into your setup, you just introduce it to the codebase and see what is the maximum pain level
							your team can suffer. Sounds harsh, I know, but then you can dial it down as you go to find a nice balance between
							productivity boost and mental damage.
							</p>
							<p>
							The setup should go from max pain rather than inducing more pain as we go - it's easier to dial it down,
							rather than bump it up.
							</p>
							<p>
							Alright, we know about what the linters are, why do we need them - now, let's figure out how we can plug them.

							I've divided our file into few smaller chunks which I recommend you set up when introducing the linters:

									<b>output</b> will contain what do you need to see from GolangCi-Lint when it prints to your output.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>issues</b> is the heart and bones of our setup, it will allow for the most important instructions for GolangCi-Lint.

							Now we know about how to introduce linters in any setup, now let's talk again about your team's morale.

							<p>
							Following our pre-established pain theory, the way how we've run the linters upscale process in our team
							was done over a week or two.
							</p>
							<p>
							Within the team we've all agreed that we have a deadline on testing the linters and we've introduced it

							The good thing about introducing well thought-out linter setup is that, as you can see,
